A plugin for [Strapi Headless CMS](https://github.com/strapi/strapi) that provides a Soft Delete feature.

## ‚ú® Features

- üõ¢ Database
  - Adds `deletedAt` and `deletedBy` fields to all your collection and single content types.
- üóÇÔ∏è Content Manager & API
  - The normal delete functionality behaves as the soft delete. It will set the `deletedAt` field to the current date and `deletedBy` field to the admin user that deleted it.
  - üë§ RBAC
    - The name of the existing admin permission reflects the soft delete functionality. The `Delete` is renamed to `Soft Delete` and it is located in the `Settings > Roles > Edit a Role > Collection Types | Single Types` section.
    - A new admin permission is added to the `Settings > Roles > Edit a Role > Collection Types | Single Types` section. This is the `Deleted Read` permission. This will allow the admin user to view the soft deleted entries.
    - A new admin permission is added to the `Settings > Roles > Edit a Role > Collection Types | Single Types` section. This is the `Deleted Restore` permission. This will allow the admin user to restore the soft deleted entries.
    - A new admin permission is added to the `Settings > Roles > Edit a Role > Collection Types | Single Types` section. This is the `Delete Permanently` permission. This will allow the admin user to delete permanently the soft deleted entries.
- üóÇÔ∏è Adds a `Soft Delete` item in the Admin left Panel to access the Soft Deleted content explorer. This will list all the content types. You can restore or delete permanently the entries from here.
  - Adds a `Restore` action through the Soft Delete in the Admin Panel to the content types. This will set the `deletedAt` field to `null` and `deletedBy` field to `null`, thus restoring it.
  - Adds a `Delete Permanently` action through the Soft Delete in the Admin Panel to the content types. This will delete the entry permanently.

<!-- - You can still access the content type by using the `includeSoftDeleted` query parameter. This will return all the content types including the soft deleted ones. -->
